Hi, I'm Adrian. There's more to come here, but if I were to discretise myself:

- Live in Sydney, Australia. Convinced it's an amazing place to be... but also where I've lived my whole life.
- Want to climb V8 at B-Pump Ogikubo, Tokyo when we're all free to travel again. I can only climb V3 Kilter problems so there's a wee bit to go!
- Embarks on cooking journeys every now and then. This season arc's project is making homemade udon noodles, transitioning into a ramen noodle nerd.
- 2016 - 2020 Computer Science at UNSW. Psyched that I completed Advanced Operating Systems.
- Software Engineer at Atlassian on the Messaging Team working on our sending e-mail stack.
- You'll find less techy things on my Insta @ridgetinez. I'm yet to get into Twitter. Contact me via email: < my-insta-handle >@gmail.com 

### My happy place
