I"í<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Adrian. Thereâ€™s more to come here, but if I were to discretise myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live in Sydney, Australia. Convinced itâ€™s an amazing place to beâ€¦ but also where Iâ€™ve lived my whole life.</li>
  <li>Want to climb V8 at B-Pump Ogikubo, Tokyo when weâ€™re all free to travel again. I can only climb V3 Kilter problems so thereâ€™s a wee bit to go!</li>
  <li>Embarks on cooking journeys every now and then. This season arcâ€™s project is making homemade udon noodles, transitioning into a ramen noodle nerd.</li>
  <li>2016 - 2020 Computer Science at UNSW. Psyched that I completed Advanced Operating Systems.</li>
  <li>Software Engineer at Atlassian on the Messaging Team working on our sending e-mail stack.</li>
  <li>Youâ€™ll find less techy things on my Insta @ridgetinez. Iâ€™m yet to get into Twitter. Contact me via email: <my-insta-handle>@gmail.com</my-insta-handle></li>
</ul>
